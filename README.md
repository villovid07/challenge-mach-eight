# Mach Eight Sample Project

## Task

​
The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.
​
Sample output is shown below.

```
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
​
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4
```

# Used tools

It was developed in typescript, using nodejs v18.13.0

# How to run

1. npm install to install all the dependencies
2. _yarn start_ to run the project

- If the project is running it will show you two inputs to type the parameters ( at first the list of numbers separated by Comma and finally the given value)

3. if you want to run the test you can use _yarn test_

I hope it fulfills with all the expectations thanks...
